## Overview
This project is a live simulation developed in Unreal Engine, representing a clock through a dynamic 3D environment. It uses objects, characters, and interactive elements to display the current time in sync with the system's real-time clock. The clock is inspired by the game Portal 2 and uses several assets imported from the game, including textures, objects and sounds. The elements:

Seconds - represented by the glowing stars.
Minutes - represented by the turrets in the testing tube.
Hours - represented by the number of turned on monitors. Additionaly, the lighting is also dynamic and changes according to the time of day.
The clock has a UI that triggers several options with button presses/keyboard keys presses:

Reset (R) - resets the clock.
Default Cam (1) - changes the camera to scene facing view (default).
Turret Cam (2) - changes the camera to view the inside of the test tube.
Boogie (M) - Activates the radio. Also makes the scientist dance if idle.
There are additional special events that happen in certain time marks.
